## The Motorcycle Safety Check (T-CLOCS)

### T - Tires and Wheels
- **Tire Pressure**: Check both front and rear tire pressure when cold
- **Tread Depth**: Look for adequate tread and no excessive wear patterns  
- **Sidewall Damage**: Inspect for cuts, cracks, or embedded objects
- **Wheel Condition**: Check for bent or damaged rims, loose spokes

**Pro Tip**: Lower tire pressure slightly for better traction in sand and soft terrain, but don't go below manufacturer minimums.

### C - Controls  
- **Throttle**: Should snap back quickly and smoothly
- **Clutch**: Check lever action and engagement point
- **Brakes**: Test both front and rear brake feel and effectiveness
- **Steering**: Ensure handlebars turn smoothly without binding

### L - Lights and Electrics
- **Headlight**: High and low beam function
- **Taillight**: Brake light activation
- **Turn Signals**: All four signals working (if equipped)
- **Battery**: Check terminals for corrosion and secure connections

### O - Oil and Fluids
- **Engine Oil**: Check level and condition
- **Coolant**: Verify level and look for leaks
- **Brake Fluid**: Check reservoir levels and fluid color
- **Chain Lube**: Ensure chain is properly lubricated

### C - Chain and Drive
- **Chain Tension**: Check proper slack (usually 1.5-2 inches)
- **Chain Wear**: Look for stretched or damaged links  
- **Sprocket Condition**: Check for hooked or worn teeth
- **Chain Alignment**: Ensure proper sprocket alignment

### S - Stands and Suspension
- **Side Stand**: Spring return function and secure mounting

## Weather and Trail Conditions

Before heading out, always check:

- **Weather Forecast**: Including conditions at your destination
- **Trail Status**: Check for closures, restrictions, or hazards
- **Daylight Hours**: Plan your return before dark
- **Local Regulations**: Permits, restrictions, fire danger ratings

## Group Ride Considerations

When riding with others:
- Establish hand signals and communication methods
- Review the route and identify regrouping points
- Assign a sweep rider to stay with slower riders
- Share emergency contact information
- Discuss skill levels and comfort zones

## Red Flags - Don't Ride If:

- You feel unwell or overly fatigued  
- Weather conditions are dangerous
- Your bike has any safety-related issues
- You don't have proper safety gear
- Trail conditions exceed your skill level

## Remember: It's About Fun, Not Risks

The goal is to return home safely with great memories and stories to share. When in doubt, err on the side of caution. There's always another day to ride!
