# Welcome to MORE

I'm excited to announce the launch of the **Motorcycle Off-Road Explorers (MORE) Club** and our new community website! After years of riding solo and with various groups, I realized there was a need for a dedicated community focused on off-road motorcycle adventures in our area.

## What is the M.O.R.E. Club?

The Motorcycle Off-Road Explorers club is built around three core principles:

üèçÔ∏è **Adventure** - We believe every trail tells a story and every ride is an opportunity for discovery  
ü§ù **Community** - We support each other both on and off the trails  
üå≤ **Conservation** - We ride responsibly and give back to the trails we love

## Getting Started

While we're just launching, I'm already working on organizing our first official club ride! Here's what you can expect in the coming months:

### Immediate Plans

- **Build the community**: Create an independent online space where members can talk about their current rides, ask mechanical questions, share stories, and plan rides
- **Spring Ride**: Planning a beginner-friendly trail exploration for when the snow thaws in 2026
- **Promote Safety**: Share resources for existing motorcycle riding training classes, and gauge interest in local off-road specific skill and safety training workshops
- **Trail Mapping**: Creating a shared resource of Missoula-area trail information

### Long-term Vision

- Regular weekly rides with varying difficulty levels (seasonal)
- Annual Montana Adventure Rally
- Skills workshops and safety training opportunities
- Trail maintenance projects and public lands access advocacy
- Partnerships with local land managers and the Missoula riding community

## Join the Adventure

Whether you're a seasoned off-road veteran or just getting started, there's a place for you in MORE club. We welcome riders of all skill levels who share our passion for adventure and respect for the riding community.

**Interested in joining our inaugural ride?** Contact us at more@ride-more.org or check out our [membership page](/members) for more information.

## What's Next?

Keep an eye on this blog for:

- Ride announcements and reports
- Trail condition updates  
- Safety tips and maintenance guides
- Club news and member spotlights

The adventure begins now - let's explore more together!
