# Why MORE?

I started working on this **MORE** community website project when I discovered that there are not really any affordable alternatives to Facebook groups. I think there are lots of other people that like riding motorcycles, and might want to connect with other motorcycle riders, but do not feel like spending time on Facebook to connect with other riders.

I have enjoyed riding motorcycles since I was a teenager. Growing up, my dad would tell stories of he and his brother riding their old motorcycles, practicing wheelies, and having a great time. My dad had a variety of bikes that I could borrow. But when a friend of mine got his own, I got more serious, got my own bike, and got my endorsement. 

My first motorcycle was a red 1983 [Suzuki GR650 "Tempter"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_GR650). I've also owned and/or ridden and worked on [Kawasaki GTR1000 Concourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawasaki_Concours), [Honda VFR800 VTEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_VFR800#Sixth_generation:_2002%E2%80%932013_VFR800_VTEC_(RC46)), [Moto Guzzi Quota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moto_Guzzi_Quota), [Honda CL450 Scrambler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_CL450), Triumph Tiger, [Suzuki DR650](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_DR650), and a few others.

I find dual-sport and adventure motorcycles to be the pinnacle of the motorcycle riding experience. A big benefit of dual-sport and adventure motorcycles is the locations they'll take you: the sites you can see, and the exclusive locations where few other people can get to.

## Where is MORE?

For more on what I've previously said on what Motorcycle Off-Road Explorers club is, go check out the [welcome post](/blog/welcome). But I haven't said anything yet about _where_ MORE is. I live in Missoula, Montana. Our family moved here, from the Seattle, area, in 2014. Montana has always had a special place in my heart, and not just because of [A River Runs Through It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_River_Runs_Through_It_(film)). We took road trips to Montana every year when I was a kid, and I've always loved the Big Sky, and the wild terrain. Then, in my early twenties, I met the woman of my dreams, and she was from Montana, so it was only a matter of time.

<!-- I live in Missoula, Montana. Many residents across Montana consider it an _important_ attribute to know how long your family has been in Montana. But the funny thing about that is, none of us had any choice in where our parents lived when we were born. I was born in Seattle, WA because my parents lived there at the time. My mom grew up in Bilings, MT, where my grandfather was a founder of the [https://www.ybgr.org/about-ybgr/our-history/](Yellowstone Boys and Girls Ranch). My wifes family has been in Montana for multiple generations, but I don't think that is particularly important. What is important is that I live here now, and I want to connect with other motorcycle riders that live in the Missoula area. -->

You may have heard that Montana will soon be the latest addition to the BDR (Backcountry Discovery Routes) network, with the [Montana BDR](https://backcountrydiscoveryroutes.com/routes/montana-bdr/) route opening in 2026. This is exciting news for dual-sport and adventure motorcycle riders, as it will provide a well-mapped and maintained route through some of Montana's most beautiful and remote areas. I look forward to learning where the Montana BDR routes will go and exploring other BDRs too.

## Where Will MORE Go Next?

Wherever you are! If you a dual-sport or adventure motorcycle rider in another town in Montana, or even another state, and you'd like to connect with other riders in your area, then let's set up a MORE page for your community.
