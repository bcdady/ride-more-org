### Local Montana Connection: onX Offroad Maps

Speaking of navigation and route planning, I'd like call your attention the only featured, Montana-based sponsor: [onX Offroad](https://www.onxmaps.com/offroad/app/features/trail-maps). OnX is a fantastic mapping platform founded right here in Missoula, Montana! onX provides detailed off-road maps with land ownership data, trail information, and offline capabilities that are invaluable for backcountry adventures like the Montana BDR.

## MORE Club Connection

This announcement is particularly exciting for our MORE (Motorcycle Off-Road Explorers) community! Montana's addition to the BDR family means we have another incredible multi-day adventure option relatively close to our region.

We're already discussing the possibility of organizing a **MORE Club Montana BDR expedition** for summer 2026. This would be an excellent opportunity for club members to:

- Experience their first multi-day adventure riding expedition
- Learn navigation and camping skills in a supportive group environment  
- Explore some of the most beautiful terrain in North America

## Stay Updated

As more details about the Montana BDR route become available, we'll continue to share updates here on the MORE Club blog. In the meantime, check out [RideBDR.com](https://ridebdr.com) for information about other available routes and to stay updated on the Montana route development.
