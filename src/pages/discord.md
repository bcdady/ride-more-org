# Join the MORE Missoula Discord Community

## What is Discord?

Discord is a free communication platform that offers text chat channels and other community collaboration features. Think of it as a modern forum mixed with instant messaging - perfect for our riding community to stay connected between rides!

### Why Discord for MORE Club?

- **Real-time communication** - Chat with fellow riders instantly
- **Organized channels** - Separate spaces for different topics (rides, maintenance, trail reports, etc.)
- **Voice channels** - Jump in for group conversations or ride planning
- **Mobile & desktop** - Stay connected whether you're at home or on the trail
- **Photo/video sharing** - Easy sharing of ride photos and trail conditions
- **Event coordination** - Plan rides and track who's joining
- **Big Tech Independence** - a.k.a. it's Not Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok
  - Reddit is also an option, but I think we can build a a more positive and focused community in Discord

## Getting Started with Discord

### Step 1: Create Your Account

1. **Visit Discord**: Go to [discord.com/download](https://discord.com/download) to download the app to your computer, iPhone, or Android. There is also a web version at [discord.com](https://discord.com)
2. **Sign Up**: Click "Register" and create your account
   1. If you don't yet use a password manager, now is a good time to start! I recommend [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) - it's free and open source. Use Bitwarden to generate and store a strong, unique password for your Discord account.
3. **Verify Email**: Check your email and click the verification link

**Pro Tip**: Use a name that's easy to recognize - your real name or riding nickname works great!
