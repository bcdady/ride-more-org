# Motorcycle Types and Riding Styles

## Introduction to On/Off-Road and Adventure Riding

Adventure riding, including the more traditional moniker Dual-Sport, combines the best of both worlds: the freedom of the open road and the thrill of off-road exploration. Whether you're touring scenic highways, exploring forest service roads, or navigating mountain trails, there's a motorcycle designed for your style of adventure. If you enjoy riding a motorcycle on a mix of pavement and dirt (or if you've not tried it yet, and think that sounds like fun), this guide will help you understand the different types of motorcycles and riding styles to find a good place to start your next adventure.

Much of the information provided here can spur energetic debates, such as which category a particular model best belongs in, which bikes are best for new riders, and which ones some owners consider to have achieved Unicorn status (1 bike to do anything and everything). But the goal here is to provide a basic foundation for understanding some useful distinctions, and approximately represent the conventional wisdom of the On/Off-Road motorcycling community at large. You are invited and encouraged to join this community in Discord to more specifically discuss your interests, skill level, and budget. Whether you are considering your first bike, looking to upgrade, or just adding another iron horse to the stable, we look forward to hearing your thoughts and questions and sharing some perspectives and feedback in return.
